# How to run

Make 4 new chorals "Victoria", "Esquimalt", "North Saanich" and "Nanaimo"

Copy the respective js function into the function box online. Only copy the function declaration not the whole file

Then you should be able to see the output

## IMPORTANT

I would suggest replacing the API key with your own key. As there is a limit of 60 req/sec on a single api key.
